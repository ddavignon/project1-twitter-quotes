# Project 1

- Dustin D'Avignon


-- What was the theme you chose?

 : I chose cute puppies to keep the theme light.

-- How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?

 : Getting the theme to work with the twitter hashtags was easier than the images. I hade to use many filters for the image url in order to get a decent looking image.

-- What are known problems, if any, with your project?
 
 : The Twitter API doesn't always return the best quotes. Sometimes the quotes are just advertisements.

-- How would you improve it if you had more time?

 : I would use the streaming api to change the quote every few seconds.
