# Project 1

- Dustin D'Avignon


1. What was the theme you chose?

I chose cute puppies to keep the theme light.

2. How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?

Getting the theme to work with the twitter hashtags was easier than the images. I hade to use many filters for the image url in order to get a decent looking image.

3. What are known problems, if any, with your project?
 
The Twitter API doesn't always return the best quotes. Sometimes the quotes are just advertisements.

4. How would you improve it if you had more time?

I would use the streaming api to change the quote every few seconds.
